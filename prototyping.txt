advantages

disadvantages

Time-consuming with great expense, especially when you in the tight budget.

Prototype design may constrain the designer's ideas, the more you design, the smaller space available to the designer. It may decrease the designer's enthusiasm. If you don’t require much design capability, you can’t design high fidelity prototype.

If the designer's knowledge is limited, it may not be possible to estimate the difficulty degree of implementation and will cause unlimited development time.
